# Easy Fluid Simulation for Godot

This Godot project demonstrates a 2-dimensional water effect that utilizes the physics engine and the [metaball rendering technqiue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs). 

## Background
This demonstration was made and presented on at a meet-up of the SLC Game Devs Discord group at Millcreek Community Library in Millcreek, Utah, USA. The original presentation, [Fast and Easy 2D Fluid Simulation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_LE85uojjjXCUUpGZrHOP-4MTcdNIx1tZ0nOZT4hfy4/edit?usp=sharing), is available on Google Drive. 

You can see an example of this same technique being used in [Pipeworks](https://starrynitegames.itch.io/pipeworks), my entry for the 49th Ludum Dare game jam. 

## Requirements
[Godot Game Engine v4](https://godotengine.org/)

## How to Use
Download the files and run the demo by calling the `godot` command. Use `godot -e` to see how scenes are constructed in the editor.
